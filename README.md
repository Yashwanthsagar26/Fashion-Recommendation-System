## A Deep Learning-based Fashion Recommender System using ResNet50

This repository implements a fashion recommender system utilizing the pre-trained ResNet50 deep learning model to analyze and recommend similar fashion items based on user preferences.

**Project Purpose:**

* Develop a personalized recommendation system for fashion products.
* Leverage deep learning features extracted from product images using ResNet50.
* Explore different recommendation algorithms for personalized experiences.

**Features:**

* Pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction from fashion images.
* Dataset of fashion images with category labels and potentially user preferences.
* Implementation of recommendation algorithms based on extracted features.
* (Optional) Web application or interactive interface for showcasing recommendations.

**Project Structure:**

* `data`: Contains the fashion image dataset and potentially user data.
* `models`: Houses the pre-trained ResNet50 model and any custom models developed.
* `scripts`: Holds Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

ResNet50, written as ResNet-50, is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. Here's a breakdown of its meaning:

ResNet: Stands for Residual Network, a specific architecture for building deep neural networks. Traditional CNNs suffer from a vanishing gradient problem, where information gets lost as it flows through deeper layers. Residual networks address this by using "shortcut connections" that bypass some layers, allowing gradients to flow more easily and enabling training of deeper networks.

50: Refers to the number of layers in the specific ResNet variant. Other common variants include ResNet-34, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, each with different numbers of layers. Generally, more layers increase the model's capacity to learn complex features but also require more data and computational resources for training.

Summary:

ResNet-50 is a 50-layer convolutional neural network based on the residual network architecture.
It's widely used for image classification tasks due to its high accuracy and versatility.
Its name reflects its architectural innovation (ResNet) and specific depth (50 layers).
